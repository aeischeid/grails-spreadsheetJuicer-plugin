Grails SpreadsheetJuicer Plugin
author: Aaron Eischeid

The spreadsheetJuicer plugin provides Grails with a service to extract the
data from simple MSexcel and OpenOffice spreadsheets into a form easily used
in groovy. Under the hood it is using apache POI and JOpenDocument libraries.

Basically it is a convience plugin to save people with relatively simple 
spreadsheets from having to work with the underlying libs which are very 
complete and can thus be a bit complex.

Additionally I have worked with the developer of jQuery.sheet, a plugin for 
displaying spreadsheet data in a browser. The resulting data format is very 
simple to convert to JSON and import into that plugin.

 -- not packaged as a plugin yet, but when it is you will be able to ...
Install from the zip file on Github.
    "grails install-plugin [path/to/zip/file]"

<------------>
    Usage:
<------------>

def ssDataHash = SpreadsheetJuicerService.getSheetAsHash(file)

simple conversion to JSON 

def ssJson = ssDataHash.encodeAsJSON()
return [params:params, ssJson:ssJson]
